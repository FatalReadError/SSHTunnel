SSHTunnel
=========
SSHTunnel is a tiny small program to tunnel something through a SSH without any external dependencies. Yes, you do not need any PuTTY installtion for Microsoft Windows. Just download the executable which matches your OS and architecture (32 vs. 64 bits) and run it.

### Syntax
*This example uses the Microsoft Windows executable, but the syntax is the same for e.g. Linux, Unix, Mac, etc.*
`SSHTunnel.exe -local 127.0.0.1:53001 -remote 127.0.0.1:27017 -server your-server.org:22 -user john -pwd johndow`

- Connects to your external server `your-server.org` to port `22`. At this port, the SSH service should run
- At the SSH server's side, connects to `127.0.0.1` to port `27017` (a MongoDB database)
- At your local side, provides a listener at `127.0.0.1` at the port `53001`
- The username for the SSH service is `john`
- The user's password would be `johndow` ;-)
- Now, you are able to use your local MongoDB software and can connect to port `53001` at `localhost`.

### Features
- The whole code is open source and can be used for any purpose (also commercial)
- If you want, you can compile the code by your own by using the Go compiler (http://www.golang.org)
- The program just needs very low resources e.g. around 1.3 MB memory for Microsoft Windows 8.1
- SSHTunnel is scalable and, if necessary, can utilise all your CPUs
- If a connection cannot setup, the program re-tries it
- At the moment, SSHTunnel uses only the password authentication methods. Therefore, it is currently not possible to use e.g. a certificate, etc. Nevertheless, the implementation of this feature is possible.
- The configuration must be provided by using the command-line arguments. It is currently not possible to use e.g. a configuration file.
